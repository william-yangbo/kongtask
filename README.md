# KongTask

KongTask is a high-performance job queue implementation for Go, inspired by [graphile-worker](https://github.com/graphile/worker). It provides PostgreSQL-backed job processing with excellent performance and reliability.

## Features

- üöÄ **High Performance**: Process 1,700+ jobs per second
- üîí **Reliable**: PostgreSQL-backed job persistence and ACID guarantees
- üéØ **Compatible**: API compatibility with graphile-worker v0.4.0+
- üîß **Flexible**: Support for job scheduling, retries, and custom task handlers
- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure**: Cryptographically secure worker ID generation (v0.5.0+ improvement)
- üìä **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and metrics support

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/william-yangbo/kongtask
```

### Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "encoding/json"
    "log"

    "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool"
    "github.com/william-yangbo/kongtask/pkg/worker"
)

func main() {
    // Connect to PostgreSQL
    pool, err := pgxpool.New(context.Background(), "postgres://user:password@localhost/dbname")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer pool.Close()

    // Define task handler
    tasks := map[string]worker.TaskHandler{
        "send_email": func(ctx context.Context, payload json.RawMessage, helpers *worker.Helpers) error {
            // Process the email sending task
            log.Printf("Sending email: %s", payload)
            return nil
        },
    }

    // Create and run worker pool
    workerPool, err := worker.RunTaskList(ctx, tasks, pool, worker.WorkerPoolOptions{
        Concurrency: 4,
        Schema:      "graphile_worker",
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer workerPool.Release()

    // Add a job
    w := worker.NewWorker(pool, "graphile_worker")
    err = w.AddJob(context.Background(), "send_email", map[string]string{
        "to":      "user@example.com",
        "subject": "Welcome!",
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Wait for completion
    workerPool.Wait()
}
```

## Performance

KongTask delivers excellent performance:

- **Throughput**: 1,700+ jobs/second with 4 workers
- **Latency**: ~50ms average job processing latency
- **Memory**: Efficient memory usage with minimal allocations
- **Concurrency**: Excellent scaling with multiple workers

## Architecture

KongTask is built with several key components:

- **Worker**: Individual job processor with secure ID generation
- **WorkerPool**: Manages multiple workers with graceful shutdown
- **Job Queue**: PostgreSQL-backed job persistence and scheduling
- **Task Handlers**: User-defined functions for job processing
- **Helpers**: Utility functions for job management

## Compatibility

KongTask maintains API compatibility with graphile-worker:

- ‚úÖ Job queue operations (add_job, get_job, complete_job, fail_job)
- ‚úÖ Task scheduling and retry logic
- ‚úÖ Database schema compatibility
- ‚úÖ Worker pool management
- ‚úÖ Performance characteristics
