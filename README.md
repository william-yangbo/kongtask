# KongTask

KongTask is a high-performance job queue implementation for Go, providing core API compatibility with [graphile-worker](https://github.com/graphile/worker) v0.5.0. It delivers PostgreSQL-backed job processing with excellent performance and reliability.

> **Compatibility Status**: Core features aligned with graphile-worker v0.5.0. Some TypeScript-specific features are not supported (see limitations below).

## Features

- üöÄ **High Performance**: Process 1,700+ jobs per second
- üîí **Reliable**: PostgreSQL-backed job persistence and ACID guarantees
- üéØ **Compatible**: Core API compatibility with graphile-worker v0.5.0 (see limitations below)
- üîß **Flexible**: Support for job scheduling, retries, and custom task handlers
- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure**: Cryptographically secure worker ID generation
- üìä **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and metrics support
- üè∑Ô∏è **Forbidden Flags**: Runtime job filtering for complex rate limiting and selective processing
- üîÄ **Task De-duplication**: Via unique `job_key` for preventing duplicate work

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/william-yangbo/kongtask
```

### Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "encoding/json"
    "log"

    "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool"
    "github.com/william-yangbo/kongtask/pkg/worker"
)

func main() {
    // Connect to PostgreSQL (local)
    pool, err := pgxpool.New(context.Background(), "postgres://user:password@localhost/dbname")
    // For a remote database (TLS), prefer `?ssl=true` in the connection string
    // e.g. "postgres://user:pass@host:port/dbname?ssl=true"
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer pool.Close()

    // Define task handler
    tasks := map[string]worker.TaskHandler{
        "send_email": func(ctx context.Context, payload json.RawMessage, helpers *worker.Helpers) error {
            // Process the email sending task
            log.Printf("Sending email: %s", payload)
            return nil
        },
    }

    // Create and run worker pool
    workerPool, err := worker.RunTaskList(ctx, tasks, pool, worker.WorkerPoolOptions{
        Concurrency:     4,
        Schema:          "graphile_worker",
        // Install signal handlers for graceful shutdown on SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc (v0.5.0 feature)
        NoHandleSignals: false,
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer workerPool.Release()

    // Add a job
    w := worker.NewWorker(pool, "graphile_worker")
    err = w.AddJob(context.Background(), "send_email", map[string]string{
        "to":      "user@example.com",
        "subject": "Welcome!",
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Wait for completion
    workerPool.Wait()
}
```

## Development

## Performance

KongTask delivers excellent performance:

- **Throughput**: 1,700+ jobs/second with 4 workers
- **Latency**: ~50ms average job processing latency
- **Memory**: Efficient memory usage with minimal allocations
- **Concurrency**: Excellent scaling with multiple workers

## Architecture

KongTask is built with several key components:

- **Worker**: Individual job processor with secure ID generation
- **WorkerPool**: Manages multiple workers with graceful shutdown
- **Job Queue**: PostgreSQL-backed job persistence and scheduling
- **Task Handlers**: User-defined functions for job processing
- **Helpers**: Utility functions for job management

## Compatibility

KongTask provides core API compatibility with graphile-worker v0.5.0:

### ‚úÖ **Supported Features**

- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Complete SQL migration alignment (000001-000005)
- ‚úÖ **Job Queue Operations**: add_job, get_job, complete_job, fail_job functions
- ‚úÖ **Admin Functions**: completeJobs, permanentlyFailJobs, rescheduleJobs (v0.4.0+ features)
- ‚úÖ **Signal Handling Control**: NoHandleSignals option for custom signal management (v0.5.0 feature)
- ‚úÖ **Task Scheduling**: Job scheduling, retry logic, and priority support
- ‚úÖ **Forbidden Flags**: Runtime job filtering for complex rate limiting and selective processing
- ‚úÖ **Job Flags**: Dynamic job filtering capabilities with static and function-based configuration
- ‚úÖ **Worker Management**: Worker pool management with graceful shutdown
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Comparable throughput and latency characteristics
- ‚úÖ **API Surface**: WorkerUtils, TaskSpec, and helper function compatibility

### ‚ùå **Known Limitations**

- ‚ùå **Dynamic Task Loading**: TypeScript's dynamic task loading from directories/modules is not supported
- ‚ùå **Runtime Task Registration**: Go's static typing requires tasks to be registered at compile time
- ‚ùå **Module System Integration**: No equivalent to TypeScript's import/require for task discovery

### üîß **Go-Specific Approach**

Instead of dynamic loading, KongTask uses static task registration:

```go
// Define tasks at compile time
tasks := map[string]worker.TaskHandler{
    "send_email": emailHandler,
    "process_payment": paymentHandler,
}
```

**Development Status**: Core job queue functionality fully compatible with graphile-worker v0.5.0. Language-specific features (like dynamic task loading) are implemented using Go patterns rather than direct TypeScript equivalents.

## Forbidden flags

When a job is created (or updated via `job_key`), you may set its `flags` to a
list of strings. When the worker is run, you may configure `forbiddenFlags` to
indicate that jobs with any of the given flags should not be executed.

```go
// Static forbidden flags
worker := worker.NewWorker(pool, schema,
    worker.WithForbiddenFlags([]string{"maintenance", "rate-limited"}),
)

// Dynamic forbidden flags function
forbiddenFlagsFn := func() ([]string, error) {
    // Check external systems, cache, database, etc.
    if isMaintenanceMode() {
        return []string{"maintenance"}, nil
    }
    return nil, nil
}

worker := worker.NewWorker(pool, schema,
    worker.WithForbiddenFlagsFn(forbiddenFlagsFn),
)
```

The `forbiddenFlags` option can be:

- `nil` (no filtering)
- an array of strings (`[]string{"flag1", "flag2"}`)
- a function returning `([]string, error)` that will be called each time a
  worker looks for a job to run

If `forbiddenFlags` is a function, KongTask will invoke it each time a
worker looks for a job to run, and will skip over any job that has any flag
returned by your function. You should ensure that your function resolves
quickly; it's advised that you maintain a cache you update periodically (e.g.
once a second) rather than always calculating on the fly, or use pub/sub or a
similar technique to maintain the forbidden flags list.

This feature enables complex rate limiting, maintenance mode controls, feature
flags, and other advanced job filtering scenarios at runtime.
